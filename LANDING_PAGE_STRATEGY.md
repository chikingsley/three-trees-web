# Landing Page Strategy: Three Trees Center for Change (Focus: Court-Mandated)

**Goal:** Create a high-converting landing page for users seeking Court-Mandated classes, emphasizing both court compliance and the unique effectiveness of Three Trees' programs. This page needs to clearly address the primary need (satisfying court requirements) while establishing trust and showcasing the value of *real* change.

**Core Value Proposition:** Satisfy Court Requirements with Classes That Create Real, Lasting Change.

**Key Differentiator:** Evidence-Based, Mindfulness-Focused Programs Proven to Work. We offer more than just a certificate; we offer a path to genuine improvement.

**Target Audience:** Individuals mandated by courts, probation officers, or legal systems to complete specific behavioral change programs (Anger Management, Domestic Violence/BIP, Substance Use, Parenting, etc.). They need a certificate of completion but may also be open to (or unknowingly benefit from) programs that offer genuine help.

## Tone & Messaging Notes:

*   **Confident & Credible:** Use assertive language regarding court acceptance and program effectiveness.
*   **Empathetic & Respectful:** Avoid judgmental language. Focus on positive outcomes and support.
*   **Benefit-Oriented:** While compliance is key, always tie it back to the *benefit* of real change.
*   **Clear & Direct:** Use simple language. Make navigation and CTAs obvious.
*   **Keywords:** Ensure terms like "court-ordered classes," "court-approved," "certificate of completion," specific course names (anger management, domestic violence, etc.), and location terms (if applicable for SEO later) are naturally integrated.
*   **"At-Home" Language:** Consistently use "at-home" or "live online group sessions" to describe the delivery format, mirroring competitor language that addresses court concerns about "online" classes.
