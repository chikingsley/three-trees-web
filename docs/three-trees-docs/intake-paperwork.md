**Notes:**

**Regarding Victim's Contact Information (Section 13):**
The collection of a victim's direct contact information by an offender program needs careful consideration. Before implementing, please consult with legal counsel and adhere to best practices for your state or federal law and specialty (e.g., domestic violence intervention programs). Key considerations include: victim safety, privacy, whether your program has a protocol for victim contact (and if this is ever appropriate for an offender program to initiate), and if this information is truly necessary for your program's service delivery versus being information the client reflects on for their own process. Often, information about the victim is gathered from the client's perspective to understand their thought patterns and risk, rather than collecting direct contact details for the program's use.

This consolidated form should give you a strong, dynamic foundation for your new intake process! Let me know if you have any adjustments or further questions.
