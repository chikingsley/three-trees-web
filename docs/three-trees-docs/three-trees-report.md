# Three Trees Center for Change - Market Research Report

## **Introduction**

Three Trees Center for Change (based in Rock Hill, SC) is a behavioral change organization offering court-mandated classes, college interventions, workplace training, and professional certification. It employs a proprietary **Cognitive Behavioral Inquiry (CBI)** model that integrates cognitive-behavioral therapy with mindfulness and trauma-informed techniques  . Over 15 years, Three Trees has served more than 40,000 individuals with evidence-based programs, reporting success rates of 85–95% in reducing recidivism and supporting personal growth  . This report provides a comprehensive mapping of Three Trees’ services and programs, a cross-checked expansion on internal market research, competitive analysis in the Southeast (SC, NC, GA, TN) with a national overview, and strategic recommendations for expansion. It also includes UX design recommendations for a website redesign (including a referral portal), best practices for enrollment workflows, and an evaluation of video call platforms for program delivery.

## **Services Offered and Program Portfolio**

Three Trees offers a **comprehensive suite of behavioral intervention programs** across several domains. The core service categories are **Court-Mandated Classes**, **College Campus Services**, **Workplace Services**, and **Trainings & Certification**  . All programs are built around the CBI model emphasizing emotional resilience, cognitive consonance, and healthy behavior change . Below is an expanded mapping of all major programs and services:

- **Court-Mandated Classes:** Structured multi-level intervention classes for court-referred clients (e.g. probationers or diversion program participants). These address substance use, anger management, parenting, domestic violence, and sexual misconduct issues .
- **College Campus CBI Programs:** Online courses for college students facing disciplinary action or personal challenges related to substance use, relationships, or aggression .
- **Workplace Services:** Training and coaching for organizations on topics like diversity, equity & inclusion, professional resilience, healthy workplace relationships, and leadership coaching .
- **Trainings & Certification:** Professional training for facilitators and organizations, including certification to deliver Three Trees’ CBI curricula in local communities .

Each category is detailed below with specific programs, delivery methods, and unique features.

### **Court-Mandated Classes**

Three Trees’ court-ordered classes use **CBI-based group curricula** to help individuals change problematic behaviors under legal mandate. Programs are offered both online (via live video classes) and in-person, maintaining identical structure and intensity across formats . They are grouped into three intensity **levels**:

- **Level 1 Classes:** Entry-level interventions requiring a minimum of 12 weekly sessions (approximately 3 months). These include *Substance Use & Responsible Thinking*, *Working with Anger* (anger management), and *Positive Parenting* . Each Level 1 class meets for ~60 minutes per week and involves 12 cognitive-behavioral assignments . Content focuses on fundamental skills: managing substance use, developing responsible thought patterns, regulating anger, and effective parenting techniques . These classes are evidence-based and considered the “gold standard” for basic court-mandated intervention .
- **Level 2 Classes:** Extended interventions (~26 weeks) for moderate/high-risk cases, such as domestic violence. The primary Level 2 program is *Safe Families, Healthy Relationships*, a 26-session domestic violence intervention (batterer intervention) with 90-minute weekly classes . Level 2 also includes an advanced *Substance Use & Responsible Thinking Level 2* workbook, reflecting that participants often complete two workbooks over the 26 weeks . These programs delve deeper into topics like power & control dynamics, cognitive distortions sustaining abuse, and advanced relapse prevention for substance use. Classes are longer in duration (often 1.5 hours) to allow group discussion and accountability work.
- **Level 3 Classes:** Intensive long-term intervention focused on *Healthy Sexual Boundaries* for individuals with sexual misconduct or offenses. The Level 3 program runs **18 months** (minimum) of weekly classes . Sessions are ~60 minutes each week and cover a phased curriculum on healthy sexuality, consent, and boundary-setting. This program is **in-person only** due to its sensitive nature and intensity . The *Healthy Sexual Boundaries* curriculum is divided into three phases (Phase 1, 2, and 3) – each accompanied by a dedicated workbook – to sequentially address cognitive patterns, trauma triggers, and behavior change related to sexual conduct .

**Key Features of Court-Mandated Services:** All court-mandated classes emphasize accountability, compassion, and transparency. **Referral sources (probation officers, judges, etc.) receive weekly progress updates** on each client’s attendance and participation . This ensures referring agencies are informed of any non-compliance or “red flags” promptly, bolstering accountability. Three Trees also offers extremely **flexible scheduling** – classes are available on weekdays, evenings, and weekends to accommodate clients’ work and family schedules . Clients may choose online group sessions or attend on-site, with both formats following the same curriculum and frequency . The organization highlights its use of **evidence-based methods** (CBI/CBT) and reports that an independent analysis found **over 95% of program graduates had no new legal issues 3 years post-graduation**   – indicating a very low recidivism rate among completers. This high success rate is a major selling point, demonstrating long-lasting behavioral change.

**Program Materials:** Three Trees develops proprietary workbooks for all classes, which participants complete as homework. Examples include *Working with Difficult Emotions*, *Positive Parenting: A CBI Workbook*, *Substance Use and Responsible Thinking (Level 1 and 2)*, *Safe Families Healthy Relationships* (domestic violence workbook), and *Healthy Sexual Boundaries (Phases 1–3)*  . These workbooks integrate psychoeducation, reflective exercises, and practical skill-building tied to the “three trees of change” – managing emotions, challenging unhelpful thinking, and aligning behaviors with goals  . The use of structured workbooks ensures consistency and depth in learning, whether a client is in Rock Hill or attending via Zoom. Each participant also has access to their facilitator between classes for coaching or questions, ensuring support is available 24/7 as needed  .

### **College Campus Services**

Three Trees provides **online cognitive-behavioral courses for college and university students**, typically those referred through campus conduct offices or seeking help for behavioral issues. These courses address common collegiate challenges – alcohol/drug misuse, conflicts on campus, and unhealthy relationship behaviors – using the same CBI methodology. The programs are delivered via a hybrid model: students work through a **workbook independently**, receive on-demand coaching, and then attend a **3-hour online class** (group session) to finalize learning  . After completion, Three Trees issues a certificate of completion and notifies the referring campus official .

Key College courses (each corresponding to a specific infraction or issue) include:

- **“Rethinking Substance Use on Campus”** – A 12-assignment CBI course for students who violated campus alcohol or drug policies . It helps students *“rethink how they make decisions regarding substance use and other daily decisions,”* examining impacts on others and their future selves . Topics include cognitive dissonance around substance use and strategies for responsible decision-making. *Typical participants:* students written up for underage drinking, drug possession, or related offenses. **Outcome:** Empowers better choices about substances; the course fee is ~$119 for participants .
- **“Responsible Relationships on Campus”** – An 18-assignment course addressing **safe relationship behaviors**, consent, and communication . It is designed for students who displayed problematic behavior in intimate relationships (e.g. dating violence, stalking, or disregard for consent). The curriculum challenges toxic masculinity, power imbalances, and thinking errors that lead to harm . Students learn about healthy boundaries, mutual respect, and how to correct harmful attitudes. *Typical participants:* those found responsible for sexual misconduct or aggressive behavior in a relationship. **Fee:** ~$149 for the program .
- **“Conflict Resolution on Campus”** – A 12-assignment course focusing on managing **anger and conflict** in non-intimate settings . This course is geared toward students who got into fights, had explosive conflicts with peers or staff, or other conduct violations due to uncontrolled anger. It teaches the difference between emotional experiences and behavioral choices, helping students respond to strong emotions more skillfully . Topics include the anger cycle, emotional literacy, mindfulness techniques, and assertive (non-aggressive) communication . *Typical participants:* students who have had confrontations with professors, roommates, or campus authorities. **Fee:** ~$119 .

**Success and Support:** These campus programs boast a **95% success rate** – in a study, 95% of students who completed the courses had *no further conduct issues for at least 3 years post-graduation*  . This is a powerful statistic for university partners concerned with recidivism in student conduct. Each student’s progress can be **monitored by a university official**: the process typically involves an official referral, regular check-ins, and a final report. Three Trees makes it *“easy to refer and track the student’s progress every step of the way”* . The workflow is straightforward: **(1)** The college refers the student via an online form; **(2)** Three Trees handles enrollment, paperwork, and sends the student their workbook; **(3)** The student completes the workbook (with coaching available by phone if needed); **(4)** The student attends the live online class with a certified facilitator to discuss each assignment and practice skills; **(5)** Three Trees sends the completion letter to the school and closes the case  . This turnkey approach is attractive to campus administrators because it outsources the heavy lifting – Three Trees provides the curriculum, instruction, and documentation, while the school simply monitors outcomes.

**Flexibility and Accessibility:** The college courses are entirely online and can be taken from anywhere in the world, requiring only an email address, internet connection, and a video-capable device . Classes are offered on weekdays, evenings, and weekends (just like the court programs) to fit students’ busy schedules . Three Trees emphasizes that these interventions help students *“recognize and fix mistakes”* while keeping them on track academically . By focusing on personal growth rather than punishment, the courses aim to turn a conduct violation into a learning opportunity that improves campus safety and student success. University partners (such as the University of South Carolina, as noted in a testimonial) have praised Three Trees for being responsive and collaborative in meeting student needs – e.g. customizing programs for virtual delivery during the pandemic .

### **Workplace Services**

Three Trees extends its behavioral change expertise to the **workplace and organizational context**. These services include training workshops, ongoing coaching, and consulting for companies or agencies seeking to improve employee behavior, team dynamics, and cultural competency. The focus areas in workplace services are:

- **Equity, Diversity & Inclusivity (EDI) Training:** Workshops to help organizations build more inclusive and equitable environments. This might cover topics such as unconscious bias, cultural competency, respectful communication, and creating systems that support diversity. (Three Trees even sells an *“Equity, Diversity and Inclusivity”* workbook as part of its collection , indicating a structured curriculum for this topic).
- **Consent and Healthy Boundaries in the Workplace:** Training focused on preventing workplace harassment and fostering professional boundaries. For example, their *“Consent in the Workplace”* course/book offers guidance on appropriate workplace interactions and addressing power dynamics . This is particularly useful for companies aiming to prevent sexual harassment and improve workplace culture.
- **Professional Resilience & Emotional Intelligence:** Programs to improve employees’ coping skills, stress management, and emotional regulation on the job. The *“Professional Resilience”* offering (also available as a workbook ) likely teaches strategies for handling burnout, feedback, and challenges at work in healthy ways. Similarly, content from *“Working with Difficult Emotions”* can be applied to help staff manage anger or frustration in the workplace.
- **Leadership and Coaching:** Three Trees provides **individual and group coaching** services, possibly for leaders or employees who need one-on-one support to change behaviors. Coaching might be used as a corrective measure (for example, an employee with anger issues may get coaching sessions) or as a developmental tool to build better communication and management skills.

Workplace services are offered both as **on-site/online trainings** and **consulting engagements**. Typically, Three Trees begins with a **free initial consulting session** for a client organization . In that session, they assess the workplace’s specific needs or issues (be it conflict resolution, diversity training, etc.) and then **tailor a program** accordingly. This custom approach ensures relevance – for example, a company struggling with internal conflicts might receive a conflict resolution series, whereas a nonprofit might seek training on trauma-informed practices for staff.

Each training engagement is **highly customized to the workplace**. Three Trees’ trainers incorporate the CBI model’s principles (mindfulness, cognitive restructuring, behavior change) into workplace scenarios. For instance, a training might include reflective exercises on personal biases (cognitive inquiry) or role-playing difficult conversations (behavioral practice). By leveraging its therapeutic background, Three Trees differentiates these workshops from generic corporate trainings – they are more experiential and grounded in proven psychology techniques.

Client types for workplace services include **businesses, nonprofits, schools, and government agencies**. Essentially any organization dealing with human dynamics could benefit. Notably, Three Trees staff travel nationwide to deliver trainings: *“Each year we travel around the country to provide trainings on topics ranging from interpersonal violence to intersectional identities and creating more equitable systems of criminal justice.”* . This indicates Three Trees has experience working with various agencies (possibly law enforcement, social services, etc.) on specialized topics like domestic violence prevention (for staff training) and justice system reform.

**Unique Selling Points:**

- Every workplace engagement is **preceded by a free consult**, which lowers the barrier for organizations to explore services .
- Three Trees can address **sensitive issues (e.g. violence, identity, trauma) in a professional setting** due to its clinical expertise. This is valuable for organizations like prisons, probation departments, or any employer dealing with employees who have a history of trauma or misconduct.
- They offer continued **coaching after workshops** to reinforce skills. For example, after an EDI workshop, managers could enroll in follow-up coaching to implement inclusive practices.
- If desired, Three Trees can integrate mindfulness practices into the workplace training, consistent with their philosophy that mindfulness is foundational to behavior change .

Overall, the workplace services transform Three Trees’ knowledge about “why people harm themselves and others, and how communities heal” into practical training for organizations . This positions Three Trees not just as a clinical service provider but as a **consultative partner** for improving workplace culture and resilience.

### **Trainings & Certification**

To amplify its impact, Three Trees offers professional training and certification programs. These services equip other professionals to deliver Three Trees’ model or incorporate its techniques in their own practice. Two main offerings exist in this category:

- **CBI Curriculum Certification:** A training program for counselors, probation officers, social workers, and other professionals to become certified **Cognitive Behavioral Inquiry facilitators**. Through this certification, individuals are licensed to use Three Trees’ evidence-based curricula in their own community . The certification training ranges from 1 to 5 days and covers how to run the cognitive-behavioral groups, how to utilize the workbooks, and how to apply Three Trees’ trauma-informed, mindfulness-infused approach . Upon completion, participants join “hundreds of counselors, probation officers, and diversion specialists” who are part of the Three Trees movement . In essence, Three Trees is creating a **network of facilitators** who can start programs elsewhere under the Three Trees model. This is a strategic way to scale impact without direct presence in every location. (For example, a probation department in another state could send staff to get CBI certified and then implement the court-mandated classes locally using Three Trees manuals.)
- **Trainings & Workshops for Organizations:** These are one-off or short-sequence trainings delivered by Three Trees experts, as mentioned under Workplace Services. The topics include *interpersonal violence, family violence, trauma, intersectional identities, and criminal justice reform* . Such trainings may not result in a certification, but they disseminate Three Trees’ knowledge at conferences or by request. For instance, a state coalition might invite Three Trees to train all its domestic violence program facilitators in incorporating mindfulness into interventions. Three Trees has indicated willingness to **“share what we have learned”** widely, traveling to provide these trainings .

**Delivery Mode:** Most certification trainings are conducted in-person (often on-site for the requesting organization or at Three Trees’ facility) . However, some aspects might be offered virtually if needed. The workshops can be at conferences or bespoke training sessions for staff.

**Outcomes and Appeal:** Graduates of the CBI certification can immediately apply an **evidence-based curriculum** in their communities, which is a strong value-add for probation departments or nonprofit program staff. Three Trees effectively multiplies its philosophy beyond its own staff by empowering others. This **train-the-trainer model** also helps adapt programs to local cultures – a certified facilitator in, say, Tennessee can deliver the class in a way that resonates with their community while still adhering to Three Trees’ proven model.

Additionally, Three Trees leverages these trainings to strengthen partnerships. If key stakeholders (like a county judge or a university counseling center staff) get trained or exposed to Three Trees’ methods, they are more likely to refer clients or contract services. It builds credibility and a reputation as experts beyond the Carolinas.

**Summary of Service Portfolio:** Three Trees stands out for covering the full spectrum: **from individual interventions (court/college classes), to systems-level improvements (workplace training, community workshops), to building capacity in others (certifications).** All services are unified by the CBI approach and boast features like high success rates, flexibility (online/in-person), and a trauma-informed, mindfulness-centered philosophy . This comprehensive approach makes Three Trees a versatile provider addressing behavioral change needs in justice, education, and corporate sectors.

## **Internal Market Report Cross-Check**

The internal market research report provided by Three Trees (September 2023) offers valuable insights that largely hold true, with some areas to expand:

- **Services and Value Proposition:** The report accurately notes Three Trees’ unique strengths: proprietary CBI model, proven outcomes (85–95% success), flexibility in delivery, and comprehensive services covering court, college, workplace, and training domains . This multi-sector versatility is a key differentiator – few competitors serve courts *and* colleges *and* workplaces with a unified methodology. Cross-checking the success statistics, the cited 95% non-recidivism rate aligns with the evidence from program evaluations . Testimonials and external data support claims of Three Trees as a **leader in court-mandated change** with innovative, mindfulness-based methods (e.g., a local psychiatrist endorses their low recidivism in DV and substance cases ).
- **Competitive Landscape (Local):** The report lists local SC competitors like Carolina Behavioral Therapy, Thriveworks Columbia, and Southern Sky Recovery . These are primarily therapy clinics or addiction treatment centers. While they operate in the behavioral health space, they are **not direct competitors** for court-mandated class referrals – they offer therapy for voluntary clients or insurance-based counseling. Three Trees is more specialized in mandated educational programs. A more direct local competitor is **CourtOrderedClasses.com**, which the report correctly identifies as a national online provider active in SC . Also in SC, one might consider local nonprofit programs (e.g., county-run anger management classes) or smaller agencies that partner with courts. The internal report’s focus on CBT-oriented clinics was a bit tangential; expanding it, the main competition in South Carolina for mandated classes comes from national online providers and perhaps state-run programs (like Alcohol Education Programs, etc.). Three Trees’ niche in Rock Hill is fairly distinct – indeed, **MapQuest’s business summary** describes it as *“a leading expert in court-mandated change”* with few direct peers locally .
- **Competitive Landscape (Regional):** The report mentions possible NC competitors like ISAE, Course for Court, AACS Counseling, and AngerMasters . This is on target: NC has a mix of providers including **ISAE Online** (a multi-state provider of court classes), specialized DUI program providers (AACS for DUI classes in NC/GA), and purely online platforms (CourseForCourt, AngerMasters). Upon cross-checking, *ISAE* (Interstate Services for Adjustive Education) indeed offers online court classes nationally, including North Carolina, covering youth and adult courses . *AngerMasters* is a web-based self-paced anger management course that serves NC clients among others . The internal note about NC’s regulatory restriction (no online DWI classes accepted in-state) is accurate – North Carolina law requires DWI offenders to attend state-approved in-person programs, meaning Three Trees (or any online provider) cannot fulfill **DWI** requirements for NC residents . However, Three Trees could still serve NC clients for other issues (e.g. anger management or out-of-state DUI). Georgia and Tennessee were not detailed in the report, but similar competitive dynamics exist (more on this in the competitive analysis section).
- **Market Trends:** The internal report highlights the trend toward online delivery and the necessity of state-by-state compliance . This is well-founded. Post-2020, **online court programs** have gained acceptance in many areas due to convenience and COVID-era remote allowances. Three Trees’ early adoption of online classes (with live facilitators) positions it strongly against competitors, so long as each target state permits or recognizes online formats. The report is correct that the industry is driven by demand for evidence-based interventions and greater mental health awareness . Three Trees’ combination of CBT and mindfulness aligns perfectly with what courts and campuses are looking for today (programs that are both **effective and humane**).
- **Areas to Expand:** The internal report primarily focused on **court and college services** in detail, with less emphasis on workplace and training. An expanded view should acknowledge the workplace training market (where competition comes from corporate training firms and EAP consultants) and the certification market (where a competitor might be, for example, NAMA – National Anger Management Association – which certifies anger management specialists, or other curriculum providers). Additionally, in discussing value proposition, it’s worth noting the **trauma-informed approach** as a differentiator: many generic court classes do not account for participants’ trauma histories, whereas Three Trees explicitly does (as seen in their mindful approach and statements by experts) . This could be highlighted more when marketing to referral sources who care about participant wellbeing (e.g., problem-solving courts, campus wellness offices).

In summary, the internal report’s findings are validated by external data and company materials. The core descriptions of services, success metrics, and the need for regulatory compliance are solid . Our expanded analysis builds on this by detailing each program, incorporating broader competitive intel (especially for GA and TN), and emphasizing additional Three Trees strengths (like its broad curriculum library and network-building through certification). The next sections address the competitive landscape in depth and then move into strategy recommendations.

## **Competitive Analysis: South Carolina, Region, and National**

Three Trees operates in a niche market of **court-mandated and behavioral intervention programs**, facing competition from both local providers and online companies. The competitive landscape can be segmented into:

- **Local South Carolina & Neighboring States:** Mainly small counseling agencies and some national online platforms serving the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee.
- **National Online Providers:** Companies offering court-approved courses via the internet across all states.
- **Specialized Programs by State:** State-certified programs (especially for domestic violence or DUI) that are mandated in certain states and could pose entry barriers.
- **Higher Education & Corporate Training Alternatives:** Universities’ internal programs or big training firms that could substitute for Three Trees in college/workplace contexts.

Below, we examine notable competitors in each segment, followed by a benchmarking table of top competitors.

### **South Carolina & Border States Competition**

**South Carolina:** SC does not have many private companies specializing in mandated classes; referrals often go to nonprofit agencies or counselors. Three Trees is unique in SC with its online reach and multi-topic offerings. Local mental health practices like **Carolina Behavioral Therapy** or **Thriveworks Columbia** are tangential competitors – they offer therapy (CBT, DBT) for issues like anger or substance abuse , but they are therapy providers rather than structured class providers. For example, Thriveworks provides traditional counseling (often insurance-based) and targets issues like depression or anxiety in the general population . These clinics may occasionally receive court-referred clients (e.g. someone ordered to get therapy), but they don’t run the kind of standardized courses or report weekly progress like Three Trees does.

A more direct SC competitor is **Southern Sky Recovery** (Bluffton, SC), which offers CBT-oriented addiction therapy . However, Southern Sky focuses on clinical addiction treatment (rehab), not educational classes for probation. Three Trees differentiates by catering to *mandated education and behavior change classes* rather than voluntary treatment only.

Because Three Trees serves all of SC via online classes, its competition includes **any online provider accepted by SC courts**. The internal report correctly cites **CourtOrderedClasses.com** as a competitor active in SC . CourtOrderedClasses is a national provider that offers a menu of court classes entirely online (with live group sessions). It is known for marketing itself as accepted in nearly all states, including South Carolina. A search of SC courts shows that some judges allow online programs like this, while others prefer local options.

**North Carolina:** NC’s landscape is influenced by stricter rules for certain offenses. For general anger management or parenting classes, North Carolinians can use online services (including Three Trees’ online classes, aside from DUI/DWI). Competitors here include:

- **ISAE (Integrated Safety and Accountability Education):** ISAE provides online and in-person classes covering defensive driving, substance abuse, anger management, etc., and has specific pages for NC courses . They operate with a similar model of offering flexible online classes to meet court requirements. ISAE likely competes on convenience and a broad curriculum, much like Three Trees, though ISAE’s branding is more about safety/education broadly (they even do traffic courses).
- **AngerMasters:** An online-only anger management course provider that sells self-paced courses of varying lengths (from 4 hours up to 52 hours). AngerMasters is national but would target NC clients seeking a quick, cheap way to satisfy a court. Unlike Three Trees, AngerMasters has **no live instruction** – it’s purely web-based reading and quizzes. It advertises instant downloadable certificates and lowest-price guarantee . For instance, a 12-hour AngerMasters course costs around $64.99 and can be done at the user’s own pace (1 hour course is $24.99, 52-hour is $149.99) . AngerMasters meets a different client profile: those who need an *immediate* certificate or cannot commit to weekly classes. While it lacks the interactive and therapeutic elements of Three Trees, it’s a formidable competitor on price and convenience for anger or minor offenses.
- **Course for Court (and related “Course For …” sites):** These are a series of online course websites (e.g., CourseForAnger, CourseForParenting, CourseForViolence) that provide simple educational modules. They often position themselves as accepted nationwide, including NC. Pricing tends to be low flat fees, and they typically promise a money-back guarantee if not accepted . For example, CourseForViolence.com offers a domestic violence class and states it will refund if a certificate isn’t accepted by a court . Their model is similar to AngerMasters – self-paced text-based courses with a quiz.
- **Local NC Nonprofits:** Some NC counties have nonprofit-led intervention programs (especially for domestic violence). For instance, in Charlotte, the county may have a contracted DV intervention provider (in-person 26-week programs). These local programs can be competitors if Three Trees tries to get referrals from those same courts. However, Three Trees could also partner or seek approval to provide an alternative (particularly for cases where the defendant can’t attend local classes due to schedule or distance).

**Georgia:** Georgia presents a mix of opportunities and strict barriers.

- For **Family Violence (domestic violence) cases**: Georgia by law requires that offenders attend a state-certified **Family Violence Intervention Program (FVIP)**, which is a 24-week in-person program. *No online classes are approved for FVIP in Georgia* – the rules explicitly state *“Participants must attend class in-person. No online classes will be approved.”* . This means Three Trees or any out-of-state provider cannot satisfy a GA court’s DV mandate unless they establish a physical program in GA and get it certified. Competition here is the dozens of certified local FVIP providers across GA (often organizations specifically focused on batterer intervention). Example: **AACS Counseling** in Atlanta runs a state-certified FVIP and anger management; they charge typically around $25 per session for 24 sessions (plus an intake fee) . Three Trees can’t directly compete in GA’s DV space without navigating that regulatory hurdle.
- For **Anger Management, Substance, or Parenting**: Georgia courts *may* allow online options at judges’ discretion, especially for misdemeanors. Competitors in GA include the same national online players (CourtOrderedClasses, AngerMasters, Open Path, etc. – see next section) who market to GA residents. Additionally, Georgia has a strong presence of in-person providers for anger management (many private practice counselors offer court-approved anger classes in major cities). If Three Trees targets GA, it might focus on those individuals whose courts permit online classes. Being an out-of-state provider is feasible if acceptance is gained case-by-case.
- **DUI School** in GA is heavily regulated (must attend a “Risk Reduction Program” in person). Three Trees does not currently offer a DUI-specific program, so that may be outside scope.

**Tennessee:** Tennessee is somewhat in between – it allows some online courses but also has state standards for certain programs:

- **DUI**: TN requires DUI School (12-hour class) to be state-approved, typically in person (though during COVID some moved online). Three Trees would likely avoid DUI-specific services unless obtaining approval.
- **Anger Management / Other classes**: Many TN courts will accept online anger management or parenting class certificates. Competitors in TN include national providers (identical to those for NC/GA). For example, **Anger Class Online (AJ Novick Group)** is commonly used; they have had clients in TN and boast acceptance (they offer an 8-hour anger class for around $65). **AngerMasters** and **CourtOrderedClasses** also serve TN clients (CourtOrderedClasses even has a page for Tennessee).
- **Local TN providers**: There are counseling centers in cities like Nashville or Memphis offering batterers’ intervention or anger classes. Also, nonprofits like the Family Safety Center in Nashville offer DV intervention. These local programs are in-person and could hold contracts with courts.

**Higher Education Competition:** For the college programs, Three Trees faces a different kind of competition:

- Many universities have **internal programs** for student conduct. For example, a college may require an offending student to attend the on-campus counseling center’s alcohol workshop or a class run by student affairs. These in-house interventions are competitors insofar as a college might choose to handle cases internally rather than refer to Three Trees. However, smaller colleges or those lacking resources might prefer outsourcing to Three Trees for expertise.
- There are also **online educational course providers for college sanctions**: One example is **3rd Millennium Classrooms** (an EdTech company providing courses like “Under the Influence” for alcohol violations, “Marijuana 101”, etc.). Those are self-paced e-learning modules (not live classes) often used as sanctions. Another example is **Vector Solutions** (formerly EverFi) which offers modules for student alcohol education. These are not interactive or therapy-based, but they are widely used because they are turnkey and cheap (often ~$35 per student license paid by the school). Three Trees’ offerings are more intensive and personal. So Three Trees competes by offering higher-touch, higher-impact programs vs. these automated modules. The **95% success rate** of Three Trees’ programs is a compelling argument against the minimal efficacy of a generic online module.
- If expanding nationally, Three Trees might encounter universities already partnered with local counseling centers or state-wide initiatives. Still, few external organizations focus on behavioral change classes for college students (most focus on prevention or online education), so Three Trees is relatively unique in this niche.

**Workplace Training Competition:** This is a broad arena. Potential competitors are:

- **Specialized Consultants/Firms:** For example, firms that do only diversity training (like Korn Ferry’s inclusive leadership workshops, or smaller DEI consultants), or firms that specialize in executive coaching for behavior issues. Three Trees’ broad content (violence, consent, resilience) is somewhat niche; not many competitors do *all* of those. However, for each topic there are many alternatives. E.g., for diversity training, an HR department could hire a consultancy or use a program like LinkedIn Learning courses; for anger management of an employee, a company might just mandate counseling.
- **Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs):** Many employers have EAP services that include counseling or training. If an employee has anger issues, sometimes EAP short-term counseling is used. Three Trees could pitch as a more structured alternative (class + coaching).
- **Corporate Online Platforms:** Some companies use online training modules for harassment prevention or ethics (e.g., Kantola or Skillsoft courses). Those are not interactive, but they set a baseline of compliance. Three Trees would be adding value by providing live, expert-led training which those platforms lack.

Given the breadth of competition, it’s useful to **benchmark top competitors** that most directly overlap with Three Trees’ core business (court-mandated programs). Below is a comparison table of key competitors, highlighting service scope, delivery method, pricing, user experience, and target clients:

| **Competitor** | **Services & Scope** | **Delivery & UX** | **Pricing** | **Client Type & Reach** | **Notable Features/Outcomes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CourtOrderedClasses.com** | Full range of court-ordered classes: DV/Batterers Intervention, Anger Management, Drug/Alcohol, Theft, Parenting, Divorce, etc. (National provider since 2007). | **Live online group classes** via webcam (“at-home in-person”). Self-paced options for some courses. Provides **proof of enrollment, progress reports, and certificate** included  . Website is functional but older-looking; registration is online. | No enrollment fee; flat fee per program (varies by length). E.g., Anger Mgmt 8hr ~$65, 16hr ~$95 (estimate). DV program likely several hundred dollars for 26 weeks. *Guarantees court acceptance or money-back*. | Individuals nationwide who need court-mandated classes (99% of U.S. counties claimed). Also used by probation/parole departments (listed as approved provider by some authorities) . | **Established reputation (10+ years, 3,700+ completions)** . Offers **case managers** for each enrollee . Emphasizes no hidden fees. Judges consider their online classes equivalent to in-person . High convenience, moderate engagement (group sessions but less personalized than CBI model). |
| **AngerMasters** | Online courses primarily for Anger Management (1hr to 52hr certificates). Also offers variants for Domestic Violence, Parenting, etc., framed as educational courses (not therapy). | **Self-paced online** (no live sessions, no instructor). Mobile-friendly modules, can start immediately and stop/continue anytime. Certificate available instantly upon completion. UX is straightforward – reading material and quizzes. | Extremely **low cost**: $24.99 for 1-hour course up to $149.99 for 52-hour course . Often $10–$15 for typical 8-12 hr courses. Offers **“lowest price guarantee”** (will beat any competitor price)  . | Individuals needing a quick, affordable solution for court or employer requirements. Nationwide reach (marketed in all states, though acceptance depends on judge). Popular with minor offenders or those on a budget. | **Pros:** Inexpensive; flexible timing; NAMA-certified curriculum ; no test in most cases (pure completion-based). **Cons:** No interaction or personalized feedback  . Focused on meeting minimum requirements, not on behavioral transformation (not a substitute for therapy) . Suitable when a certificate is the main goal. AngerMasters reports high customer ratings for ease of use. |
| **Open Path** (Open Path Collective) | Multiple **self-paced courses**: Anger Management, Parenting, Alcohol/Drug, *and* Batterers Intervention. Nonprofit model to make court courses accessible. | **Self-paced online** courses accessible 24/7. No live component. After registration, users get access to all course content. There is a final exam for some courses; certificate issued after completion (and purchase). UX: simple, text-based modules with some videos; caters to low-tech users as well. | **Ultra-low cost**: one-time $4.99 membership gives access to all courses  . Then, **certificate fee** on completion: ranges from $17 for a 4-hour course to ~$115 for a 52-hour course  . (E.g., a 12-hour anger class certificate ~$45). Total cost is far below most competitors. | Nationwide **budget-conscious clients** (Open Path’s mission is to serve those who can’t afford typical classes). Many are court-referred individuals with financial hardship, as well as those taking classes for self-improvement. Open Path also partners with courts or probation in some areas by being on referral lists due to its nonprofit status. | **Strengths:** Very affordable; wide variety of classes; developed by professionals; meets “most court mandates” in terms of content . They allow unlimited time to complete. Highly accessible – even homeless clients have used it . **Weaknesses:** No interaction or customization; certificate purchase adds a step. Because cost is so low, some courts might question quality, but Open Path has generally positive reviews as a credible provider. Great option for courts concerned about defendants’ ability to pay. |
| **Local State-Certified Programs** (e.g., GA FVIP, TN BIP, etc.) | **In-person programs mandated by state law** for certain offenses (e.g., 24-week Domestic Violence/FVIP in GA, 26-week BIP in TN, state DUI schools, etc.). Scope is narrower: typically one type of program (DV or DUI). | **In-person group classes** (weekly meetings at a physical location). Traditional classroom style, often psychoeducational. UX depends on provider – generally more stringent attendance policies (no flexibility for missing sessions), and may lack online conveniences. | Moderate to High: e.g., Georgia FVIP providers can charge up to $60 per class by regulation , totaling up to $1440 for 24 classes (many charge ~$30/week = $720 total). These are often out-of-pocket as well. DUI schools have fixed fees (e.g., ~$350 for GA Risk Reduction 20-hr course). | Offenders **required by law** to attend these specific programs. Clients are local (must attend in person in their county or region). These programs serve court-mandated populations with no alternative (or as a condition for license reinstatement, etc.). | **Strength:** Guaranteed acceptance (since they are the officially sanctioned programs). Facilitators are certified by the state, programs adhere to strict standards. **Drawback for participants:** No online option (in many cases), so less accessible for those with schedules or transportation issues . From Three Trees’ perspective, these represent *barriers to entry* rather than direct competitors that market freely – Three Trees would need to become one to compete in that space. |
| **ISAE / OnlineEducationPrograms** (typical multi-topic provider) | Broad set of court classes: defensive driving, anger, petty theft, alcohol, etc. ISAE in particular also does in-person in some states. Scope is similar to Three Trees on surface, minus the therapeutic coaching aspect. | Mix of **scheduled webinars and self-paced modules**. For example, ISAE offers some classes equivalent to 8-hour in-person sessions delivered in one day online . Website is modern; enrollment straightforward. Likely quizzes or knowledge checks are included. | **Mid-range cost**: Defensive driving at ISAE starts $35 ; longer classes up to $150. Their courses are priced per course, with some offering expedited options for a fee. Likely similar pricing for anger/drug courses ($75–$150 range depending on hours). | Clients across many states, often those referred to ISAE by courts or those searching online for classes. Marketed as a one-stop solution for various minor offenses. Also targets employers (e.g., their defensive driving for companies). | **Feature:** Some courses are fully narrated and mobile-friendly . ISAE positions itself as an official-sounding education institute which can appeal to courts. They emphasize ease (“fulfill your court-ordered program” enroll today) and have local presence in multiple states, giving them credibility. No published outcome stats; focus is on compliance and education. |

*Table: Benchmarking key competitors in court-mandated/behavioral intervention programs.*

**Analysis of Competitors:**

- **Service Scope:** Three Trees covers a unique combination of **court, college, and workplace** programs. None of the competitors above serve all those areas simultaneously. CourtOrderedClasses and Open Path have wide court class catalogs (even more class types than Three Trees in some cases, like theft or divorce classes), but they do not venture into college-specific programs or corporate trainings. This means Three Trees has an edge in diversification – it can approach different markets. Conversely, focus can be a strength of competitors: e.g., Open Path focuses solely on providing low-cost access, and CourtOrderedClasses focuses on legal compliance classes, which might mean they have deeper penetration in those niches.
- **Delivery & UX:** Three Trees emphasizes **live, facilitator-led classes** (even online) with interaction and coaching, which sets it apart from many competitors that are either fully self-paced (AngerMasters, Open Path) or primarily self-study. CourtOrderedClasses is the closest in delivery style, as it also uses live group sessions – however, Three Trees’ class sizes might be smaller and more intimate (since it’s not serving thousands at once) and the **CBI model ensures a more therapeutic atmosphere** rather than just lecturing. Competitors like AngerMasters and Open Path have a slick user experience for quick completion, but lack personal engagement. Three Trees’ UX for sign-up currently involves contacting the center or filling a form (“Sign Up Now” on the site) – this can be improved to match the instant enrollment capability competitors offer. One advantage Three Trees holds is the **combination of online convenience with personalized oversight**, which many others lack.
- **Pricing:** Three Trees’ pricing (from the website: $119 for a 12-lesson course, $149 for 18-lesson, etc., and presumably a few hundred for longer programs) is **higher than self-paced online courses** but comparable to in-person programs. For example, $119 for a college course is reasonable given the depth; an equivalent from Open Path would be maybe $4.99 + ~$30 certificate, and AngerMasters ~$65, so Three Trees is 2–3x more expensive than the cheapest options. However, Three Trees provides significantly more service (live classes, coaching, reports). For mandated clients who can afford it (or whose agencies pay), the extra cost is justified by quality. In corporate training, Three Trees would charge custom rates (likely contracts worth hundreds or thousands of dollars), which competes with corporate training budgets rather than these low-cost providers. **Open Path’s model is a notable outlier** – it undercuts everyone on price by design. For any expansion strategy, Three Trees should be aware that cost-sensitive courts or clients might default to Open Path if they are aware of it. Highlighting Three Trees’ superior outcomes and interaction is key to justify its higher cost. Additionally, Three Trees could consider offering a sliding scale or a “scholarship” for indigent clients to avoid losing them to Open Path entirely.
- **Outcomes:** Three Trees touts measurable outcomes (like 95% non-recidivism) , whereas competitors typically do not publish long-term outcome data. Most competitors measure success by program completion and customer satisfaction rather than behavior change. This is a **branding opportunity** for Three Trees – to be the evidence-based, results-oriented provider in a field where many are simply meeting checklist requirements. If Three Trees can continue to back up claims with data (reduced re-offense rates, improved anger management scores, etc.), it can distinguish itself especially to institutional clients (courts, universities) that care about efficacy, not just checking a box. For instance, a problem-solving court might be persuaded by Three Trees’ recidivism stats over a generic online class.
- **Client Types:** Three Trees often deals with **referral sources** (like a judge or dean) who send multiple clients, whereas a competitor like AngerMasters deals directly with individuals googling for a quick course. CourtOrderedClasses and Open Path do both (they attract individuals and have some referrals). Three Trees should leverage its strength in B2B/B2Institution relationships. It can pursue formal partnerships (MOUs with courts, contracts with colleges), which the low-cost competitors typically do not have (they rely on being “accepted” but not officially contracted). By securing contracts (e.g., being the designated provider for a county’s diversion program), Three Trees can lock in a client base that won’t be swayed by cheaper one-off options.

Overall, Three Trees’ main competitors in the **court class space** are the online class providers (for volume of potential users) and the state-mandated local programs (for certain categories like DV/DUI). Three Trees outshines the former in quality and the latter in flexibility (online reach), but must navigate price and compliance accordingly. In the **college space**, competition is weaker – likely internal programs or smaller ed-tech offerings – and Three Trees’ success record gives it an edge when pitching to schools. In the **workplace arena**, competition is broad, but Three Trees can find a niche with organizations that value its justice-related expertise (e.g., training staff in probation, or companies with workforce coming from various backgrounds).

The next section will consider regulatory factors that influence how Three Trees can expand against this competitive backdrop.

## **Regulatory Considerations for Multi-State Expansion**

Expanding Three Trees’ services beyond South Carolina requires careful attention to **state and local regulations**, as well as legal and logistical factors such as contracting and consent processes. Key considerations include:

- **State Certification and Program Approval:** Many states regulate certain court-mandated programs. As discussed, **domestic violence intervention programs** (often called Batterer Intervention Programs or Family Violence Programs) frequently require state approval. For example, **Georgia law mandates in-person FVIP classes and explicitly forbids online classes for court credit** , so Three Trees would need to get certified by the Georgia Commission on Family Violence and likely open an in-state office to serve DV clients there. Similarly, **DUI programs** in most states (NC, GA, TN, etc.) must follow state curricula and be licensed – NC’s ADETS for DWI or GA’s Risk Reduction are examples. Three Trees would either have to adhere to those or avoid claiming to meet DUI requirements in those states. For **anger management, parenting, substance abuse classes**, states usually do not have a single accrediting body, but individual courts or probation departments might have **lists of approved providers**. It is crucial to **research each target state’s requirements** for accepting online classes. In North Carolina, for instance, general anger management or drug education online is acceptable if the judge approves, but as the internal report notes, *online DWI classes are not accepted for NC offenses* . In Tennessee, many courts accept online certificates but some judges prefer local programs for DV or anger. To navigate this, Three Trees can seek **pre-approval or registration** in states: e.g., apply to be on official provider lists (some states let providers submit curricula for vetting). If feasible, partnering with a local certified program to deliver content (co-branding) could be a workaround – e.g., Three Trees could supply the curriculum while a local licensed facilitator “hosts” it to meet state rules.
- **County-by-County Contracting Models:** The justice system is often decentralized. In some areas, each county (or each judicial circuit) contracts with specific providers for diversion or probationary programs. For example, a county might have an exclusive contract with a local counseling center to provide all court-ordered anger management classes, funded by probation fees. When expanding, Three Trees should investigate **local contracting practices**. In South Carolina, a lot is informal (judges give a list of options). In states like Florida or California, there are more formalized contracts (RFPs for services). Three Trees might need to approach each county’s court administration or probation office to present their services and negotiate being added as an option. An ideal path is to target **pilot counties**: identify a county with high need and no strong existing program (or openness to alternatives) and propose a partnership. Success in one county can then be used as a case study to approach neighboring counties. Another model is state-level contracts: for instance, some states might allow a provider to serve multiple counties under a single agreement (especially if the state centralizes some probation functions). However, local buy-in is critical in the court domain. Three Trees may consider **hiring or partnering with region-specific liaisons** (people who know the local system) to navigate this.
- **University and School Policies:** For campus services, each college has its own disciplinary process. There is usually flexibility for outside programs, but some colleges may require **memoranda of understanding (MOUs)** or vetting before sending students off-campus (or online) to a program. Three Trees should be prepared to show its program aligns with educational outcomes and student privacy standards. They might also need to address **FERPA** (student privacy law) considerations if they are sharing completion data with universities – likely handled via student consent or an agreement with the school. Ensuring that the letter of completion and records can be shared with the referring school in compliance with privacy law is important. Generally, if a student signs a release, this is covered.
- **Consent Form Validity & Digital Signatures:** Three Trees, by operating online, will need robust **digital consent and intake forms**. For multi-state clients, the forms should cover liability, confidentiality, and consent to participate in a counseling/educational program that may cross state lines. **Electronic signatures** are valid federally under the E-SIGN Act, but it’s wise to confirm that, for example, a probation department will accept an e-signed weekly progress report or whether they insist on original signatures. Most courts now accept digital documents, but Three Trees should implement a secure system for capturing signatures on enrollment forms, progress reports, and completion certificates. One consideration is if any state requires a specific form or wording – e.g., California courts sometimes have specific affidavits for online programs. Three Trees might adapt its paperwork per jurisdiction. Additionally, if working with minors (in campus context or juvenile courts), parental consent is needed; digital processes must account for that extra layer of consent.
- **Insurance and Licensure:** Practicing across state lines can trigger issues around professional licensure if the services are considered “counseling”. Three Trees frames them as classes (education), not therapy, which helps avoid needing clinical licenses in each state. However, facilitators should ideally have some credential recognizable broadly (like a counseling license or a Certified Anger Management Specialist certification) to instill confidence. If any facilitators do therapeutic processing, one must be cautious not to violate psychology licensing rules across states. In expansion, sticking to an educational model (curriculum-driven, skills-based) is safest legally. Still, checking state regulations for “behavioral programs” might be prudent – some states might require program facilitators to have certain backgrounds (e.g., Colorado requires DV providers to be licensed counselors or certified by the state).
- **Data Privacy and Compliance:** Using online tools (Calendly, Stripe, video platforms, etc.) introduces data considerations. Three Trees should ensure compliance with **HIPAA** or other privacy laws if any client health information is involved (though these classes are educational, they deal with personal behavior data that should be protected). When expanding to, say, California, consumer privacy (CCPA) might technically apply if dealing with California residents’ data. Ensuring the tech stack (Next.js app, databases) is secure and compliant will be important for reputation and legal safety.
- **Local Cultural and Legal Nuances:** Aside from formal regulations, expansion should heed differences like language needs (e.g., offering Spanish versions of classes in states with large Hispanic populations) or addressing state-specific laws in the curriculum. For instance, drug laws differ by state; a substance abuse class might need slight tweaks if given in a state with legal recreational marijuana vs. one without. While core principles remain, acknowledging local context in examples or content could improve acceptance by participants and officials.

In conclusion, **multi-state expansion must balance consistency with adaptability**. Three Trees should maintain its high standards and core model, but adapt delivery to meet each locale’s legal requirements. A prudent strategy is to **start in states with fewer barriers**: for example, North Carolina (for non-DWI classes) and Tennessee (for general classes) may be easier initial expansions since they have no blanket prohibition on online classes for many issues. Georgia is more challenging due to DV rules, but perhaps focusing on anger management and college programs (which are not covered by GA’s prohibition) could open that market. Building relationships with officials and possibly obtaining formal recognitions (letters from judges that they accept Three Trees’ online program, etc.) will mitigate regulatory hurdles through social proof even when no official approval system exists.

## **Strategies for Market Expansion**

To grow beyond its current footprint, Three Trees should pursue a multi-pronged expansion strategy that addresses partnership development, marketing, differentiation, and compliance. Below are recommended strategies, including ideal pathways for contract acquisition in various regions:

### **1.**

### **Southeast Regional Focus (Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee):**

Leverage Three Trees’ existing presence in South Carolina to expand outward:

- **South Carolina Deepening:** First, ensure **dominance in SC**. This means engaging more directly with SC referral sources – host informational sessions for solicitors (prosecutors), probation officers, and judges across SC counties to cement Three Trees as the go-to provider. If SC has any statewide probation or court conference, present there. Emphasize the 95% success stat and weekly updates , which local providers likely can’t match. By owning SC, Three Trees creates a strong base (testimonials, references) to show neighboring states.
- **North Carolina Entry:** Start by targeting **metropolitan areas near Rock Hill**, e.g. Charlotte (Mecklenburg County, NC). Charlotte’s proximity means Three Trees can offer some in-person services if needed (it’s a short drive), which might appease any reluctance about online-only. Approach Mecklenburg Court or probation about being an approved provider for anger management or other classes – possibly propose a *pilot program* where a batch of probationers use Three Trees Online and outcomes are measured. Meanwhile, partner with colleges in NC: for example, Winthrop University (in Rock Hill) could recommend it to peers in UNC system, or directly reach out to UNC Charlotte, NC State, etc., highlighting that Three Trees’ campus programs kept students offense-free through graduation . For NC’s DWI issue, consider **not** entering DUI space initially, or partner with a local DWI school to handle that module while Three Trees handles other parts (this could be part of a holistic offering for courts). Being flexible will help break in.
- **Georgia Strategy:** Focus on areas where online classes are more readily accepted. Georgia’s major urban courts might be stricter, but many **rural or suburban courts** may allow online options for anger or theft cases. A contract acquisition path here is to **approach probation agencies**: in GA, private probation companies supervise misdemeanor probation in many counties. These companies (like Sentinel, Judicial Alternatives, etc.) often decide where to send probationers for classes. Pitch Three Trees to these probation services as a resource – they might love the idea of an online option to refer people who can’t attend local classes (due to distance or schedules). If one of these probation companies adopts Three Trees across multiple counties, that’s a big inroad. Also, emphasize that Three Trees can handle “difficult” cases (e.g., those who failed out of other programs) because of the intensive nature of CBI, thus helping probation meet their goals. For officialdom: consider getting Three Trees’ curriculum approved by the Georgia authorities for certain programs. If expansion budget allows, pursuing FVIP certification in GA (which might entail hiring a GA-licensed clinician and running an in-person 24-week group, possibly in parallel with online homework) could eventually unlock that market – but as a near-term strategy, stick to what’s permissible (anger management, etc.) and **obtain letters of support** from any GA judges who do accept the program to show others.
- **Tennessee Outreach:** Identify some **model courts or agencies** in TN that are innovation-friendly. For instance, Nashville has a Behavioral Court and a strong recovery court network. Reaching out to the directors of those programs (even if Three Trees’ classes are supplemental rather than core requirements) could be beneficial. Also, Tennessee colleges (UT Knoxville, Vanderbilt, etc.) could be target customers for the college programs, since they often face Title IX mandates for education after incidents. As for contract path: Tennessee’s probation is mostly state-run via the Department of Correction for felonies and private for some misdemeanors. Perhaps start with misdemeanors – contact a medium-size city court and offer to handle their anger management caseload for a trial period. **Local partner approach:** If possible, partner with a known Tennessee counselor (maybe a Three Trees certified facilitator from training) who can be the local face while using Three Trees’ online platform. This hybrid local-online presence can satisfy any local preference and ease client concerns.
- **Marketing & Differentiation Regionally:** In all these states, shape marketing messages around: **outcomes (lower recidivism)**, **convenience (classes any time, no travel)**, and **accountability (weekly reports, case manager assigned)** . For officials, highlight cost savings: if offenders complete programs successfully at high rates, courts spend less time on violations or re-sentencing. Also, mention that Three Trees’ programs address underlying issues (trauma, thinking errors) rather than just checking a box – so it’s an investment in community safety. This resonates with judges who want to see behavior change, not just compliance.

### **National Expansion via Online Presence & Strategic Partnerships:**

Beyond the neighboring states, Three Trees should scale methodically:

- **Enhance Online Visibility:** Competing with national providers means **winning online search**. Three Trees should invest in SEO and content marketing. For example, publish authoritative articles or resources on “completing court-mandated classes online” or “college disciplinary programs” that rank highly and reference Three Trees. Perhaps translate the success and uniqueness into press releases or YouTube content (they have a YouTube channel and TikTok listed) . Engaging social media with educational content can build brand recognition. The internal report suggests using platforms like TikTok, Instagram to share free tips and resources , which can attract individuals looking for help (and then they find out about the courses).
- **Partnerships with Courts & Agencies:** On a national level, consider partnering with organizations that span multiple states. For instance, the **American Probation and Parole Association (APPA)** or similar bodies – Three Trees could offer training or present at their conferences, thus indirectly promoting their services to probation departments nationwide. Another route: team up with **legal services or attorney networks**. Defense attorneys often advise clients on how to fulfill court requirements – if Three Trees is known to attorneys as a reputable option, they will send clients. Develop a referral program or simple info sheet for attorneys (“Why recommend Three Trees to your client who needs a class?” emphasizing certificate acceptance and quality).
- **College Consortiums:** Reach out to multi-campus systems or associations of student conduct administrators (e.g., ASCA – Association for Student Conduct Administration). Offering to host a webinar or provide a white-label service could net multiple schools. For example, state university systems might adopt Three Trees as an option if pitched at the right level.
- **Affiliate or Licensing Model:** As demand grows, Three Trees can’t directly serve every state in person. However, through the certification program, they can **license their curriculum** to qualified local partners (who become certified). This essentially franchises the model. The report alludes to “joining the 100s of counselors” using the approach – formalize this into an expansion strategy. By training professionals in various states (especially those with license requirements), Three Trees can claim presence there. Those local partners could secure county contracts (which they might not have been competitive for without an evidence-based curriculum), benefiting both parties. For example, a probation officer in Texas gets CBI certified and starts a Three Trees-style program, sending a portion of fees as royalties while achieving outcomes. This *“train others”* approach is scalable and spreads brand recognition nationally.
- **Differentiation from Online-Only Competitors:** Emphasize that Three Trees offers **real human interaction** and **coaching** – something CourtOrderedClasses and others might do, but not with the same therapeutic approach. A possible tagline: “More than a class – a change program.” The goal is to attract those decision-makers who are not satisfied with bare-minimum online courses. By positioning Three Trees as the premium, results-driven option (like the “Mercedes” of court classes), it can justify why a court or client should choose it over a $5 course. Part of this differentiation could involve obtaining some form of **third-party accreditation**. If any national accreditation exists for correctional programs or if Three Trees can partner with a university for evaluation, that stamp can set it apart. For instance, “our curriculum is proven in a study by [University] to reduce reoffending” – that is gold in marketing to officials.

### **3.**

### **Regulatory Navigation & Compliance Strategy:**

Rather than seeing regulations as roadblocks, integrate them into the expansion plan:

- **Hire/Consult Legal Expertise:** As expansion goes multi-state, have a legal advisor or compliance officer review each new state’s requirements ahead of launch. This saves embarrassment of offering a program a court later rejects. Being proactive, e.g., getting a letter from NC DMV that “Three Trees is not valid for NC DWI” and then *not* marketing that service in NC, shows respect for rules.
- **Localize Consent & Contracts:** Develop a **standardized but adaptable contract template** for services with government entities. For example, a contract for providing services to a county might include data sharing agreements, insurance liability coverage, etc. Having a ready template can speed up acquisition (officials appreciate not having to draft one from scratch).
- **Trial & Test**: Possibly run **small-scale pilots in various regions** first. For example, allow a limited number of self-paying clients from different states to enroll and see how acceptance goes. If any certificate gets rejected by a judge, find out why and address it (perhaps by providing additional documentation or tweaking wording). The internal plan to ensure “court acceptance” is critical – many competitors promise money-back guarantees , and Three Trees should be prepared to do the same to build trust when entering new areas.

### **4.**

### **Targeted Contract Acquisition Paths by Region:**

Different regions of the U.S. have different systems and needs. Some suggested pathways:

- **Southeast (beyond SC, NC, GA, TN):** After establishing in these four, look at Alabama and Florida. Alabama often has limited resources in rural areas for such classes – an online provider could fill gaps, and the state doesn’t centrally prohibit them (except DUI). Florida has many private providers, but also many problem-solving courts that might welcome an evidence-based online option for low-risk offenders. A strategy could be to partner with a Florida drug court to use Three Trees for their misdemeanor track participants, for example.
- **Northeast:** States like New York and Massachusetts often have strong nonprofit sectors. A contract path here might be through **county probation departments** (NY) or **trial court services** (MA). Highlighting Three Trees’ mindfulness aspect may resonate in progressive jurisdictions. Also, in densely populated states, offering online classes can alleviate waitlists for existing programs. Perhaps find a champion (a judge or probation chief) in one city to pilot and then expand to state associations.
- **Midwest:** Many Midwestern states allow online classes generally. The approach could be via **state judicial conferences** – for instance, the Illinois or Ohio judicial conferences might be interested in new tools for offender rehabilitation. Presenting at those venues can open doors. Additionally, approach **universities** in the Midwest (Big Ten schools, etc.) which may have interest in off-campus programs, especially if they’ve had high-profile incidents (e.g., fraternity hazing – Three Trees could create a custom course for that).
- **West Coast:** California is a huge market but very regulated in DV and DUI. However, California courts do allow online programs for anger management and parenting in many cases. A strategy could be digital marketing to California defendants directly for those classes while gradually building relationships. Also, target **tech companies and military bases** on the West Coast for workplace and coaching services – these clients might later become advocates for the method in their communities. For Washington/Oregon, the culture might appreciate the trauma-informed approach; perhaps collaborate with their extensive network of treatment providers (for example, offer CBI certification to counselors in those states to extend reach).

Throughout, maintain **quality control** – expansion should not dilute the quality of facilitation. If scaling via new hires or partners, ensure they are well-trained in CBI model to keep outcomes high.

### **5.**

### **Outcomes Tracking and Evidence:**

Make robust outcome tracking part of expansion. As Three Trees enters new jurisdictions, collect data (completion rates, recidivism at 6 months, 1 year, client satisfaction surveys, etc.). Use this data to continuously improve and also to sell the program. For example, if expansion to NC yields a 90% successful completion without new violations at 1 year, share that with NC officials along with a testimonial from one of them. Essentially, **turn successful expansion steps into marketing for the next step**.

By combining these strategies – focusing regionally, building partnerships, leveraging online marketing, adapting to regulations, and proving results – Three Trees can expand methodically and establish itself as a **national leader in behavioral change programs**. As one professional endorsement said, *“there is no better place to go”* for these interventions , and with strategic growth, Three Trees can make that true across many states.

## **Website UX and Redesign Recommendations**

As Three Trees grows, its website will be a critical touchpoint for clients (individuals and referring organizations alike). A redesigned website should cater to two primary user groups: **public-facing users (mandated individuals or their families, and general public)** and **referral portal users (court officials, college administrators, EAP managers)**. Below are recommendations for an improved UX, organized by user type and key feature:

### **Public-Facing Website Enhancements**

**1. Clear Service Navigation:** Organize the homepage to immediately direct users to their relevant area of need. For example, use distinct call-to-action tiles or buttons: “Court-Ordered Classes,” “College Programs,” “Workplace Training,” and “Professional Certification.” Each should lead to a dedicated landing page describing that service in user-friendly terms. Currently, the site has a Services menu, but making these options very obvious on the homepage (perhaps with icons or images, as is partially done  ) helps users self-identify where to go.

**2. Simplified Content and Visuals:** Ensure each service page succinctly explains what programs are offered, how they work, and their benefits. Use short paragraphs, bullet points, and headings to improve readability (e.g., list class levels under Court Mandated with bullet points for each, similar to how the internal report table summarized them  ). Incorporate visuals like icons (e.g., a gavel icon for court classes, a graduation cap for college, briefcase for workplace) to reinforce the context. Testimonials or success statistics should be highlighted in call-out boxes – e.g., *“95% of our college program graduates have no new issues 3 years later”*   displayed prominently on the College page, or a quote from a judge on the Court page.

**3. Emphasize Credibility and Outcomes:** The public site should reassure skeptical visitors (especially those mandated to attend) that this program is legitimate and effective. Include a section on the homepage for **“Why Three Trees?”** with quick facts: number of years in operation, individuals helped (>40,000) , success rates , and professional endorsements (like the quote from Ken Lenington, MD on the current homepage) . Also, feature logos of any partner institutions or courts (if permitted) to show trust. A short **“Evidence-Based Model”** section can explain CBI in lay terms (e.g., “Our Cognitive Behavioral Inquiry model combines cognitive-behavioral therapy with mindfulness – a proven approach to change behavior ”).

**4. User-Friendly Writing and Tone:** Many users visiting are under stress (court-involved or students facing discipline). The text should be **reassuring, clear, and actionable**. Avoid academic jargon; use empathetic language like “You’re not alone – we’re here to help you fulfill your requirements *and* truly change for the better.” Keep paragraphs brief and break text with subheadings so users can scan. The current site’s text like “Welcome to our court mandated services…”  is a good welcoming tone, but it can be more direct about next steps.

**5. Prominent Calls to Action (CTAs):** For individuals, the main CTA is likely “Enroll Now” or “Sign Up.” Each service page (Court, College, etc.) should have a clear button like **“Sign Up Now”** (as currently present ) that leads to the enrollment process. Also consider CTAs like “Contact Us for Help” with a phone number, since some users may have questions or prefer calling (the site currently lists the phone on bottom; making it top-right and very visible is better, e.g., “Call us: (803) 207-0558” always visible ).

**6. Responsive and Accessible Design:** Many users will access via smartphones (especially younger college students or busy adults). The redesign should ensure mobile-friendliness: easy tap targets, quick page load, no overwhelming large text blocks on small screens. Use high contrast and legible fonts for accessibility, and provide alt text for images. Also, provide the option for Spanish (or other languages) if serving diverse populations (even if via Google Translate plugin initially).

**7. Informational Resources:** Adding a **FAQ page** (the site already has an FAQ link , but the content isn’t visible in our scrape) can reduce user anxiety. Common questions like “Will my court accept this class?”, “How do online classes work?”, “What if I miss a session?” etc., should be addressed. This helps individuals trust and commit to enrolling. For college programs, a section for parents might help (as parents often get involved if their student is in trouble).

**8. E-Commerce Integration (Bookstore):** The site’s Bookstore listing of workbooks   is a nice feature, but ensure the shop is easy to navigate and purchase from. If workbooks are mainly for internal use or certified facilitators, perhaps restrict or clarify that. If selling to the public, highlight how they complement the classes.

### **Referral Portal Features**

For referral sources, the website should incorporate a secure portal or at least dedicated pages:

**1. Dedicated Referrer Homepage:** Create a section of the site (e.g., “For Professionals” or “Referral Partners”) accessible from the top menu. This page would speak directly to judges, probation officers, attorneys, campus officials, etc. It should highlight how Three Trees makes their job easier: *“Refer a client/student to us in one minute, and we handle the rest – scheduling, progress updates, and completion certificates.”* It should also link to evidence (outcomes, testimonials from other professionals). Provide a clear CTA here such as **“Create a Referral Account”** or **“Refer Someone Now”**.

**2. Secure Referral Portal:** Implement a user account system where approved referral partners can **log in to a dashboard**. Features of this portal should include:

- **Submit a New Referral:** A simple form where the referrer enters the client’s name, contact info, required program (e.g., “Anger Management Level 1” or “Conflict Resolution Course”), and any case identifiers. Once submitted, Three Trees staff gets notified to reach out to the referred person. Ideally, an automated email could also go to the client with instructions to enroll online using a special link.
- **Track Participant Progress:** The portal should list all referrals made by that user (or their agency) and show status: e.g., “John Doe – Anger Management – 5/12 sessions completed – on track, next session 10/5,” or “Jane Smith – Completed on 9/15, certificate delivered.” This real-time tracking fulfills the weekly update need in a convenient way . It saves Three Trees from manually sending emails (though email alerts can still be integrated).
- **Download Reports/Letters:** Allow referrers to download progress reports or the final certificate/letter of completion from the portal. For instance, once John Doe finishes, the probation officer can log in and directly obtain his completion letter (PDF). This immediacy is a big UX win for busy officers who otherwise wait for snail mail or emails.
- **Messaging/Notes:** Possibly include a secure messaging feature so a referrer can communicate with the facilitator (e.g., “John missed last week, please notify me if he misses another” or Three Trees can leave a note “client rescheduled session due to illness”). This keeps a log of communications all in one place.

**3. Ease of Use and Onboarding for Referrers:** Many referrers are not tech-savvy or don’t have time to fuss with new systems. The referral portal should have a **clean, minimal interface**. Use the referrer’s language (like “Case Number” instead of internal jargon). Also, provide a quick guide or even assign a rep to walk new referrers through setup. For example, if a county signs an MOU, Three Trees could host a 30-minute training for probation officers on how to use the portal – or at least provide a one-page visual guide.

**4. Security and Privacy:** Ensure the portal is secure (HTTPS, strong passwords, possibly 2FA if dealing with sensitive data). Each referrer should only see their own referred clients – or their agency’s, if a group account. Given progress notes can be considered confidential, have users agree to terms when signing up, and protect data according to standards (storing minimal personal info needed, etc.).

**5. Integration with Internal CRM:** On the backend, the portal could tie into Three Trees’ systems (like a Convex database or Sanity content store) so that staff updating attendance records automatically update the portal data. This reduces double data entry.

Implementing such a portal will significantly upgrade Three Trees’ professionalism and scalability. Competitors like CourtOrderedClasses already mention offering proof of enrollment and progress reports  , but a modern web portal could surpass their typically old-fashioned methods (fax or email). It becomes a selling point: “24/7 online access for referral partners to monitor progress.”

### **Multi-Step Enrollment & Scheduling Forms (Best Practices)**

One critical aspect of UX is the enrollment flow for clients. Enrolling in a course may require collecting personal info, case info, scheduling a class time, payment, and agreeing to terms. A **multi-step form** can handle this in a user-friendly way. Best practices for designing this form with Next.js (frontend), Sanity (CMS for content), Convex (backend data), and third-party tools (Calendly, Stripe, etc.) include:

**1. Divide the Form into Logical Steps:** Avoid overwhelming the user with a single long form. Break it into 4–5 digestible steps, for example:

- *Step 1: Contact & Case Information* – name, email, phone, referring agency or court (maybe a dropdown of common ones or free text), case number (if any), which program they need to enroll in (they can select from a list; this could be pre-filled if they came via a referral link).
- *Step 2: Scheduling* – choose class dates/times. This is where Calendly or a scheduling module comes in. Ideally, after they choose their program in Step 1, Step 2 shows available class sessions for that program. Integrating **Calendly**: you could embed a Calendly widget that’s filtered to a specific event (for example, Calendly event for “Anger Management Class – Mondays 6pm” with recurring slots). The user picks a start date for their classes. Alternatively, if classes are on a rolling enrollment, maybe they just choose a general slot and Three Trees assigns the exact start date.
- *Step 3: Payment* – use **Stripe or Square** to collect fees securely. Next.js can integrate Stripe Checkout: clicking “Proceed to Payment” can redirect to a Stripe-hosted checkout page with the item (e.g., “Anger Management Course Level 1 – $X”). Ensure to handle success/cancel redirects. If some users have a coupon or were pre-paid by an agency, allow an option to skip payment (e.g., “enter voucher code” that zeros out fee).
- *Step 4: Agreements* – present digital consent forms, terms of service, privacy policy, and an agreement that non-compliance may be reported to referrer. Use checkboxes like “I agree to the terms” and perhaps a digital signature capture (could be just typing their full name as signature, or a drawn signature pad). Using a library or service for e-signature (like DocuSign API or similar) is possible but might be overkill; a well-designed form that records the IP timestamp of agreement is often enough for these purposes.
- *Step 5: Confirmation* – a summary page that confirms their enrollment is complete, shows next steps (e.g., “We have emailed you confirmation and a link to download your workbook. Your first class is on [date] via [Zoom link or platform].”) and perhaps an onboarding video or instructions.

**2. Use Sanity CMS for Form Content:** Sanity can be used to manage dynamic content in the form. For instance, the list of programs, descriptions, pricing – these could come from Sanity so that staff can update without coding. If a new course is added, you add it in Sanity and it appears as an option. Also, consent form text, terms, etc., can be stored in Sanity for easy editing. Next.js can fetch these via GROQ queries at build or runtime.

**3. Smooth UX Details:** Provide a **progress indicator** (e.g., Step 2 of 5) at the top of the form so users know how many steps remain, alleviating anxiety. Make sure that if users navigate away or lose connection, their entered data isn’t lost – using Convex or local storage to save partially completed steps is helpful. Also allow going *back* to previous steps to edit if needed (especially before final submission).

**4. Form Validation and Guidance:** At each step, validate inputs and give friendly error messages. For example, ensure email is valid format, required fields are filled, etc., before moving on. If a user tries to skip a required field, highlight it in red with a note like “Please enter your case number (if none, write N/A)”. Keep the tone helpful. When scheduling, if no slots are available that work for them, provide a contact link (“Don’t see a convenient time? Contact us – we’ll work with you.”) rather than just blocking them.

**5. Integrating Calendly:** Calendly can be embedded via an inline widget or popup in Next.js. It can push selected time info to Convex or your form state via webhooks. For example, once a Calendly booking is completed, you can redirect back to the form to continue (Calendly supports redirect after scheduling). Alternatively, build a custom scheduler with Convex storing class session times and availability. But using Calendly or similar (SavvyCal, etc.) might expedite development, since they handle timezones, reminders, etc. Ensure to set up Calendly event types for each class type offered, or use a single event with questions to route (less ideal).

**6. Payment Integration:** Using **Stripe Checkout** is often simplest: it handles all card info securely and returns a success token. In Next.js, you’d likely create an API route (serverless function) to create a Checkout Session with Stripe’s SDK, then redirect the user to it. After payment, Stripe can redirect back to a Next.js page (like /enroll/success) with the session ID, which you then verify via another API call (or via webhook). On success, mark the enrollment in the database as paid and complete. Make sure to also handle if a user abandons payment – maybe keep their info for a while so they can resume.

**7. Convex for Data Handling:** Convex can be the database to store enrollment records. Each form step could save into a draft record (with a status field – e.g., “in_progress”, then “pending_payment”, then “completed”). Convex functions (which are serverless backend functions with transactional DB access) can perform operations like verifying a referrer code, checking class capacity before confirming a slot, sending a notification to staff on new enrollment, etc. Convex is good for real-time updates too, so potentially the referral portal could be powered by Convex for instantaneous progress updates.

**8. Digital Consent & E-signature:** For consent forms, a straightforward method is to display the text in a scrollable box (ensuring they scroll through or at least have the ability to) and have a checkbox “I agree”. Also have a required field where they type their name as signature and maybe their birthdate for identity confirmation. The combination of checking the box and providing their name and date can serve as an electronic signature. Store this with a timestamp. If needed, you can generate a PDF of the signed agreement and store or email it to them for their records. There are libraries like pdf-lib in Node.js to programmatically create PDFs. But a simpler path is to email a confirmation containing the text of what they agreed to. When expanding multi-state, if any specific disclaimers are needed (like “this class is not a substitute for therapy” – which AngerMasters clearly states  – that could be part of the terms to avoid misunderstandings).

**9. User Accounts (optional):** Consider whether the individual needs an account login. For one-time class enrollees, forcing account creation might deter them. The process can mostly be done with just forms and email confirmations. However, having an account might be useful for them to check their schedule or access class links. A compromise: create an account behind the scenes (username is their email) and email them a temporary password as part of enrollment completion, saying “Use this to log into your Student Dashboard”. That dashboard (similar to referrer portal but limited to their own info) could show their class schedule, a link to join the online class (if via integrated video platform), ability to reschedule via Calendly if needed, and downloadable copy of any assignments or their payment receipt. This adds value and reduces how often staff need to resend info.

**10. Next.js, Sanity, Convex Integration:** Next.js will serve the pages and can do SSR/SSG for the brochure content. Use Sanity as the content source for the static parts (text, images). For the interactive parts (forms, portal), use Next.js API routes or middleware to interface with Convex or directly incorporate the Convex React client (Convex has a React client for real-time). You might store form schema or options in Sanity (like list of programs and descriptions), then actual form submissions in Convex for processing. Ensure to optimize bundle by loading heavy libraries like Stripe only when needed (e.g., at payment step). Also, test performance – multi-step forms should feel snappy (Convex’s  realtime makes it possible to reflect changes quickly, but also ensure that moving from one step to the next doesn’t reload the entire page unnecessarily – likely use React state or a state machine library like XState to manage multi-step flow on the client side).

By following these best practices, the enrollment process will be smooth and reassuring, reducing drop-off. A poor signup UX can lose customers who then seek a simpler competitor site, so it’s crucial to make it as easy as, if not easier than, signing up for say AngerMasters or Open Path (which are very straightforward). The advantage of multi-step is it feels guided and less daunting.

## **Video Call Platform Evaluation (Daily vs LiveKit vs Agora)**

Delivering online classes effectively requires a reliable video conferencing solution integrated into Three Trees’ platform. Below is an evaluation of three leading options – **Daily**, **LiveKit**, and **Agora** – considering pricing, features, and integration ease:

**1. Daily (Daily.co):** Daily is a managed video API platform.

- **Pricing:** Daily has a usage-based pricing model of about **$0.004 per participant-minute for video** streams . This means a 60-minute class with 10 participants costs 60 * 10 * $0.004 = $2.40. Audio-only minutes are cheaper ($0.00099 per min) . Daily also offers packaged plans (e.g., $9/month starter which includes some minutes) . Recording is extra ($0.0135 per recorded minute) . Overall, Daily’s cost is moderate – not the cheapest, but straightforward and scalable.
- **Features:** Daily provides **HD video calling, screen sharing, recording, chat, and breakout rooms**. It also has built-in support for large calls (up to hundreds of participants in some plans). Daily emphasizes ease of embedding – with prebuilt UI components or the option to build custom layouts. They handle the heavy lifting of TURN servers, scaling, and support all major browsers and mobile.
- **Integration Ease:** Daily is known for its simple developer experience – a few lines of JavaScript can create a call frame you embed. They have a React library that works well with Next.js. Because it’s managed, Three Trees wouldn’t need to run any servers for Daily – just include the script and use their API key. Many developers report quick setup times with Daily’s documentation. Additionally, Daily handles cross-browser issues and updates seamlessly (though there have been some noted compatibility issues with certain browser versions, per one source , but those are likely edge cases).
- **Pros/Cons for Three Trees:** Daily’s ease means faster time to launch integrated video classes. It supports **grid view for group classes** and can be customized to show names, etc. It allows **private rooms** generation on the fly (e.g., one per class session). Security: Daily can enforce meeting tokens so only authorized users join. The pay-per-use model means costs rise with usage, but if classes are, say, 50 people * 1hr per week, 200 hours of participant time -> ~$48/week, which is manageable given class fees. Daily does not require participants to install anything; they join via link – very user-friendly. It might lack some complex real-time features like reaction emojis or advanced moderation tools out-of-the-box, but those can be built atop it. For Three Trees, which likely needs breakout discussions or one-on-one moments, Daily supports breakouts by creating multiple rooms or using tracks.

**2. LiveKit:** LiveKit is an open-source WebRTC platform that can be self-hosted or used via LiveKit Cloud.

- **Pricing:** If self-hosting, LiveKit itself is open-source (no license cost), but you incur **server costs and bandwidth**. If using **LiveKit Cloud**, they have tiered plans: free dev tier, then $50/month for a base (with certain included usage), and usage-based billing beyond that . LiveKit Cloud’s pricing was recently evolving ; they mention $0.12/GB for WebRTC streaming as a metric for livestream, but for interactive calls, pricing might be similar to Daily in magnitude (they have hinted pricing alignment with usage). A rough comparison: LiveKit and Agora are often around $1.99 per 1000 video minutes which is $0.00199/min per participant , possibly giving LiveKit a slight cost edge if usage is high and especially if self-hosted on affordable infrastructure. But self-hosting means you pay for bandwidth and machine uptime – not trivial if classes run daily.
- **Features:** LiveKit offers a **full toolkit for building custom video/audio apps**. It supports all core features (video, audio, screen share, data channels for chat, etc.). It has SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) architecture, meaning it can handle large rooms efficiently by selectively forwarding streams. LiveKit is very flexible – one can build breakout rooms, recording (though for recording you integrate with something like LiveKit’s example or use separate media server), and even add custom processing (like audio analysis) because you have lower-level control. It’s open source, so developers can even extend it. They have SDKs for web, iOS, Android, and even Unity.
- **Integration Ease:** Using LiveKit Cloud is fairly straightforward – they host the server, and you use their client SDKs. It’s more developer-intensive than Daily because you likely will build more of the UI and logic. There are example React apps to start from. If self-hosting, complexity rises: you need DevOps to deploy the LiveKit server (in Docker or on a cloud instance) and ensure scaling (maybe using Kubernetes or multiple instances for reliability). This is a significant overhead for a small organization unless they have a dedicated dev team.
- **Pros/Cons:** **Pros:** Ultimate control – you can tailor the UX fully. If Three Trees wanted, say, an integrated whiteboard or to label participants as “Facilitator” vs “Client” with privileges, that’s doable. LiveKit’s open nature means no vendor lock-in and possibly lower long-term costs at scale. **Cons:** Upfront development is heavier. Also, with self-hosting, you must manage quality (like scaling bandwidth). For instance, if many classes happen at once, the server must handle many streams; cloud providers like Daily/Agora handle scaling automatically across global data centers. LiveKit Cloud offers a middle ground but is newer and not as battle-tested as Agora or Daily’s networks. If reliability and simplicity are priorities, LiveKit might be more maintenance. That said, **LiveKit’s quality is reported as very good** and since it’s WebRTC, latency is low, which is great for interactive classes. For Three Trees, if resources allow, LiveKit could be integrated to provide a seamless in-app classroom experience (like not even needing to leave the site or have external branding). It could even allow an app in the future (since mobile SDKs exist). But it’s likely more than needed initially.

**3. Agora.io:** Agora is a large-scale Communications-Platform-as-a-Service (CPaaS).

- **Pricing:** Agora uses a pay-as-you-go model, roughly **$0.002-$0.003 per minute per user for video** (depending on video quality and volume) . One source indicates $1.99 per 1000 minutes for HD video , which is $0.00199/min, making Agora slightly cheaper than Daily’s $0.004/min rate. However, Agora charges for other features separately: cloud recording costs additional (they store recorded streams and charge for both recording and storage). They do have a free tier (e.g., first 10,000 minutes free each month currently) which helps during initial usage. If Three Trees scales to thousands of class hours, Agora might have cost advantage due to their global infrastructure efficiency.
- **Features:** Agora is feature-rich: beyond standard video calls, they offer built-in **cloud recording, streaming to CDN (for large webinars), real-time messaging, voice calling, and advanced audio processing** (e.g., noise suppression, voice detection). They support up to very large sessions (hundreds or more). They also have advanced tools like **virtual backgrounds**, **voice modulation**, etc., which might not be needed for classes but show their depth. Agora provides SDKs for all platforms. They are known for strong mobile performance (some popular social apps use Agora for voice chat).
- **Integration Ease:** Agora’s SDK is more complex than Daily’s. It’s lower-level in some ways; developers might need to handle more room logic. But they do provide UIKits and sample apps. Setting up requires an Agora account and using their token system for secure join. It’s not overly difficult for a competent developer, but it’s another step up in complexity. Documentation is extensive, and support is available (though often via community unless you have high volume).
- **Pros/Cons:** **Pros:** Agora has a global network with lots of relays – meaning if participants are geographically dispersed, Agora likely provides excellent connectivity and low latency by using servers closest to each user. Their system is highly reliable given its widespread use. They also allow **multi-host** scenarios (e.g., multiple facilitators) and can handle recording all streams server-side which might be useful if Three Trees ever wants to archive sessions for compliance or review. **Cons:** Pricing can become complex if using many features (need to watch the usage costs). Also, integration is a bit more involved, and debugging issues might require dealing with their support. For Three Trees, a mid-size org, Agora might feel like enterprise-level – powerful but perhaps more than necessary. If classes are relatively small groups (under 20 people, say) and mostly within the US, the global prowess of Agora might not be fully utilized. But if Three Trees plans to have clients logging in from anywhere, Agora ensures consistent quality.

**Comparison Summary:**

- **Cost:** LiveKit (self-host) can be cheapest at scale (just server costs), Agora and Daily are comparable with Agora slightly cheaper per minute. Daily’s simplicity might save development cost which offsets its higher per-minute fee for moderate usage. If expecting thousands of users, cost differences matter; if just dozens at a time, the difference is minor.
- **Features:** All three support the core needs: group video, screen share, etc. Agora has the most bells and whistles and global coverage; Daily has everything needed for interactive classes (and recording) with less setup; LiveKit allows for highly custom features if needed (like dynamic layouts or integrating class-specific data into the stream).
- **Integration:** Daily wins for ease (especially with Next.js, likely just include script and maybe a serverless token generator). LiveKit requires more coding but you own the solution. Agora is in between – robust but more to learn.

**Recommendation:** For Three Trees starting out with a referral portal and integrated class platform, **Daily** is an excellent choice due to its ease and strong support for small-group interactive video. It allows quick integration into the Next.js app (embedding a video call within the Three Trees site UI), and the usage costs are reasonable given the high-value service being delivered (a few dollars per class session). Daily would let Three Trees control the branding (no Zoom logo, etc.), which maintains professionalism.

If Three Trees anticipates needing highly specialized control or significantly higher volumes, it could later transition to **LiveKit** to save on costs or add custom logic – especially if they want to self-host in a cloud environment they control. LiveKit could even be run in parallel for certain cases (e.g., maybe they use Daily for routine small classes, but if one day they run a large webinar or training with hundreds of attendees, they could spin up a LiveKit or use Agora for that scenario). However, maintaining two systems might not be needed initially.

Agora is a great option if Three Trees wanted a one-stop global solution with lots of expansion options (like adding dial-in by phone, or text chat integration all under one roof). But the integration overhead and dealing with usage monitoring might not be worth it unless scaling dictates it.

In summary:

- **Daily**: Best for now – quick to implement into the new Next.js app, known to be developer-friendly, and offers all features needed for interactive classrooms with a predictable cost . Daily’s reliability and quality are generally praised, and any minor limitations (like occasional browser quirks) are actively managed by them .
- **LiveKit**: Best for later if customization or cost control becomes paramount. It’s an open-source path to reduce per-minute costs by leveraging your own infrastructure at the price of more devops effort. It might suit an eventual on-premise offering of Three Trees (imagine if a government wanted the solution hosted on their servers – LiveKit could enable that, using Three Trees curriculum and portal).
- **Agora**: Strong choice for a widely distributed client base or if needing advanced features like phone access or real-time analytics on call quality. If Three Trees finds Daily’s capacity or features limiting, Agora can handle virtually any scale. It might also come into play if Three Trees were to build a mobile app for clients – Agora’s mobile SDKs are very mature.
Ultimately, any of the three could work, but given Three Trees’ likely priorities (rapid deployment, seamless UX, manageable cost), **Daily.co’s solution stands out as the balanced option**.

By implementing the above recommendations – from refining services and competitive positioning to upgrading the digital user experience and technology stack – Three Trees can strengthen its foundation and successfully expand its reach. The organization’s commitment to evidence-based, compassionate intervention is a key asset; coupling that with strategic partnerships, a modernized web platform, and targeted growth efforts will enable Three Trees to thrive in the multi-state market while continuing to deliver life-changing outcomes for individuals and communities.

## **Prioritized Recommendations**

To conclude, here are the top strategic actions Three Trees should take, organized by priority level:

**Immediate Priorities (0–6 months):**

1. **Website Redesign & Portal Launch (High Priority):** Rebuild the website with clear service sections and launch the referral portal with multi-step enrollment forms and integrated scheduling/payment . This will improve conversion and stakeholder satisfaction right away.
2. **Strengthen Local Partnerships (High Priority):** Double down on SC and NC relationships – meet with local courts and colleges to secure referral pipelines. Ensure weekly progress updates and high success rates are communicated as a selling point . Satisfied local partners will serve as reference accounts.
3. **Integrate Daily Video Platform (Medium Priority):** Implement Daily.co into the online class delivery to replace or augment Zoom. This can coincide with the portal launch to offer a seamless “join class” experience. It’s largely a one-time dev setup and will pay off in branding and ease of use.
