**Re:** Past Due Payment on Balance

Good Afternoon.

This letter is to remind you that you have a past due balance with our Agency. The status of your account and program enrollment has been coded as "Completion Pending Payment" since the week of [DATE_CODED]. At the time of your last class session it was agreed upon that a payment would be submitted on a weekly basis or at a minimum basis of one time per month.

At this time your balance is $[BALANCE_AMOUNT] and your payment is considered past due as we have not been contacted regarding this matter for a period of over [TIME_PERIOD] consecutive weeks.

If additional information is needed please contact our office at 803-207-0558.
